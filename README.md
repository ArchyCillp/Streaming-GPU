# Streaming-GPU

The work aims to practice the applicability to use GPU resources in Streaming systems (Apache Flink in this repo).  We wish we could use GPU to accelerate the SQL processing speed by utilizing the advanced hardware resources. 

The current plan of this work is as follows:

1. Use JNI to call GPU resources in simple Flink UDF.

2. Design some experiments to show what difference can GPU bring to work.

3. TODO...(Update 2020/7/24)
